Dear Friends,
<br><br>
<p>
It gives me immense pleasure to brief you about STES's Sou. Venutai Chavan Polytechnic, and an established name in the field of Technical Education.
</p>
 
<p>
All the activities in the Institute are student centered. No activity benefiting the student goes untouched. At times, we go beyond curriculum and see that our students pass out not only with good marks but very good Technical Knowledge and skills.
</p>
 
<p>
The Institute has excellent Infrastructure, more than adequate experienced and qualified faculty and enriched library.
</p>
 
<p>
Sports & cultural activities are highly encouraged. An active placement cell provides wide placement opportunities.

With Best Wishes
